        <p>Give! is a true community effort, and it takes the goodwill and elbow grease of more than 100 local businesses, foundations and individuals, plus 337 matching grantors, to pull it off each year. We offer our sincerest thanks to these
          public-minded people for their support, and we hope you, dear reader, will join us in applauding their philanthropic spirit</p>
