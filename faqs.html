Nonprofit organizations depend on a variety of people to make their organizations flourish. When young donors get involved with a nonprofit organization, they can have an important long-term impact, not only in helping to raise funds, but as volunteers, engaged participants, maybe ultimately as members of the board of directors. We want to encourage younger people to participate with the nonprofit community, to become lifelong partners with the nonprofit of their choosing.<br>
