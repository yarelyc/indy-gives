            <h1><strong>WHY&nbsp;DONATE THROUGH MONTEREY COUNTY GIVES?</strong></h1>
            <p>You can donate to the overall match or to one or all 169 organizations participating in the Monterey County Gives! It’s easy, and you can even donate different amounts to each organization, if that is your wish. Best of all, every
              organization you donate to through Monterey County Gives! will receive an additional amount on top of your donation through the overall match. This overall match is pro-rated based on a percentage each organization raises, up to
              $75,000. </p>
            <p>In addition, some organizations also have individual Challenge Gifts. Your support goes a long way when you donate through Monterey County Gives! It’s a win for everyone.</p>
            <h1>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h1>
            <p>Thanks to generosity of our Partners and Sponsors, Monterey County Gives! has raised an Overall Matching Fund. This pool of money will be used to provide the pro-rated match. If you wish, you too can support the Overall Match Fund on
              the <a href="https://www.montereycountygives.com/donate/">Donate</a> page.</p>
            <p>After the campaign ends, the Community Foundation will calculate the fees, the cost of which is covered by the Overall Matching Fund. Last year, the fee was 2.9% and included credit card, administration, website and design costs. Each
              participating nonprofit is then sent a check that represents 100% of the donations it received through the campaign, along with the pro-rated match. Last year this match percentage was 12%.</p>
            <h1>WHAT IS A CHALLENGE GIFT?</h1>
            <p>A challenge gift is a donation that helps inspire more gifts for the recipient nonprofit. It can come from an individual, a family, a business, or a group like a Board of Directors. The donor is recognized on nonprofit’s page on the
              MCGives! website, and in the MCGives! issue of the Monterey County Weekly (if received before the publication date). If you would like to make a challenge gift, you should contact the nonprofit you wish to support directly.</p>
            <h1>IS MY ONLINE DONATION SECURE?</h1>
            <p>Yes. Your online donation is made through a secure server.</p>
            <h1><strong>WHEN DOES THE CAMPAIGN START AND END?</strong></h1>
            <p>Monterey County Gives! kicks off on Thursday, November 8, and ends at&nbsp;midnight December 31 (PST).</p>
            <h1><strong>CAN I DONATE THROUGH THE MAIL?</strong></h1>
            <p>Yes. Donors who do not wish to donate online may mail donations to:</p>
            <p><strong>Community Foundation for Monterey County<br>
              </strong><strong>Attn: MC Gives!<br>
              </strong><strong>2354 Garden Road<br>
              </strong><strong>Monterey, CA 93940</strong></p>
            <p>Checks must be made payable to the Community Foundation for Monterey County (on the memo line write in: MCGives!) and include a detailed list of which organization(s) you are donating to. Include your address, phone, and email
              address. If donating to multiple organizations, please combine onto one check and include a list of the individual amounts you’d like applied to each organization.</p>
            <h1><strong>WHAT IS THE MINIMUM DONATION?</strong></h1>
            <p>The minimum donation accepted is $5.</p>
            <h1><strong>WHAT ARE THE ADDITIONAL AWARDS?</strong></h1>
            <p> $2,500 Ingenuity Grant: This grant is awarded to one nonprofit that demonstrates ingenuity and creativity through their approach in resolving their sector’s challenges.</p>
            <p> $1,000 Largest Number of Donors Award: This award will be given to the nonprofit that has the most donors.</p>
            <p> $1,000 Most Donors ages 18-35 Years Old: This award will be given to the nonprofit that receives the most donations from those who are 18-35 years old (born from 1983-2000). It is meant to challenge younger readers and participating
              organizations to generate excitement around youth philanthropy, and for the next generation to experience the feelings of joy and reward that accompany acts of generosity. The goal is to jumpstart vital lifelong partnerships between
              younger donors and the local nonprofit community, with the hope that as their financial position grows so will their contributions and involvement.</p>
            <h1><strong>WHY AN&nbsp;INCENTIVE FOR DONORS 18-35 YEARS OLD?</strong></h1>
            <p>Nonprofit organizations depend on a variety of people to make their organizations flourish. When young donors get involved with a nonprofit organization, they can have an important long-term impact, not only in helping to raise funds,
              but as volunteers, engaged participants, maybe ultimately as members of the board of directors. We want to encourage younger people to participate with the nonprofit community, to become lifelong partners with the nonprofit of their
              choosing. If you are a donor in this age range, please enter your birth year on the checkout page when you make your donation.</p>
            <h1><strong>HOW WERE THE ORGANIZATIONS SELECTED?</strong></h1>
            <p>A request for proposals was published in the <a href="http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/">Monterey County Weekly</a>&nbsp;for several weeks during June and July. Our panel looks reviews the eligible organizations (that submitted
              applications by the deadline and is a 501(c)3 organization in good standing) and looks for the Big Ideas and missions that we believe can make a difference for our community in the upcoming year. To be eligible for next year’s campaign
              an organization should look for the announcements in the Weekly and follow the application instructions.</p>
            <h1><strong>CAN I DONATE STOCK OR FROM MY IRA?</strong></h1>
            <p>Yes, we can accept donations of stock as well as from Individual Retirement Accounts (<a href="http://www.cfmco.org/ira/">Click here for more information on IRA Charitable Rollovers</a>). For instructions, please contact Brian Thayer
              at the Community Foundation for Monterey County at&nbsp;<a href="tel:831-375-9712">831-375-9712</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:briant@cfmco.org">briant@cfmco.org</a>.</p>
            <h1><strong>CAN I MAKE A DONATION ON SOMEONE ELSE’S BEHALF?</strong></h1>
            <p>Yes. On the checkout page, you will have the option to select&nbsp;a dedication option: “This is an honorary or memorial gift.” You will then be prompted for more information, including the person you wish to acknowledge, and the
              option to send an email to someone to let them know about your gift. Please note that if you are donating to multiple organizations at one time, each organization will receive notification of your honor/memory gift.</p>
            <h1><strong>ARE DONATIONS TAX DEDUCTIBLE?</strong></h1>
            <p>Yes. Donors will receive an email receipt immediately after making an online donation. In addition, you will receive an acknowledgement letter from the Community Foundation for Monterey County (Tax ID #94-1615897) for donations of
              $250 or above.</p>
            <h1><strong>WILL CASH DONATIONS BE ACCEPTED?</strong></h1>
            <p>Cash donations can be made at the Monterey office of the Community Foundation for Monterey County. The address is 2354 Garden Road, Monterey, and the office is open 8:30 AM-5:00 PM Monday through Friday. Please roll coins or convert
              to dollars. Also, be sure to include the name of the organization to which the donation applies. If the cash donation is from multiple donors, include the total number of donors and total number born between the ages of 18-35 so that
              we may count them for the additional awards.</p>
            <h1><strong>WHO HANDLES THE MONEY FROM THE DONATIONS?</strong></h1>
            <p>All donations are overseen and managed by the Community Foundation for Monterey County. In February of next year, the Community Foundation will disperse 100% of all donations each individual nonprofit organization receives during the
              campaign, adding to this total the pro rata match.</p>
            <h1><strong>CAN MY DONATION BE MADE ANONYMOUSLY?</strong></h1>
            <p>Yes, please specify that you would like to remain anonymous when you submit your donation.</p>
            <h1><strong>HOW WILL THE OVERALL MATCH BE APPLIED?</strong></h1>
            <p>The overall match will be divided based on the percentage of the total donations received during the campaign by each organization. This match will only apply to the first $75,000 raised by an organization.</p>
            <h1><strong>WHO CAN I CONTACT IF I HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS?</strong></h1>
